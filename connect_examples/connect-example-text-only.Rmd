# An R Markdown Document for Sending an Email

We can create a text-only email using **RStudio Connect**. Only one function is required: `attach_connect_email()`. Files can be attached using the `attachments` argument.

None of the content from this R Markdown file will be included in the email message body, but, if we wanted to, we could elect to attach the output file using `attach_output = TRUE`.

```{r connect_email, echo=FALSE}
attach_connect_email(  
  subject = "RStudio Connect Text Email",
  attachments = "austin_home_sales.csv",
  text = "

Hello,

This is a test email. It contains only text and it's a great option if you only want to send a simple email.

We can still include attachments. Here, a CSV file is attached to this email (`austin_home_sales.csv`).

"
)
```
