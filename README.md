# Cut down on the grunt work. Deliver insights more effectively with RStudio Connect

You built a great data science product. Something your stakeholders want and have been asking for.  

But operationalizing that data product is hard. 

How do you deliver it to interested stakeholders in the format that they want with the specific insights that they need? And what if you need to deliver your data products to multiple stakeholders, all with slightly different requirements? 

How do you make sure that the data product is always up to date? And when the data is updated, how will your stakeholders know? 

This is why we built RStudio Connect. RStudio Connect is the best way for data science teams to curate and share data products with their organizations. It comes with all of the bells and whistles that professional data science teams typically need to turn their analyses into value. 

In this live event, we’ll do a deep dive into one of RStudio Connect’s most powerful features: scheduling and distributing data science products. 

This feature enables data science teams to take all of their data science products and insights and deliver them to everyone that needs them to make decisions. Always on time, in the format that they want, and as efficiently as possible.

Specifically: we will show how a data scientist can deploy an R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook to RStudio Connect, then schedule the data product to update and get delivered to interested stakeholders. All without the traditional work associated with updating data pipelines and updating reports. 

Put simply: we think RStudio gives data scientists, data engineers, and business users superpowers, and we can’t wait to show it off to you.
